One the pancake starts solidifying, use a spatula or wooden spoon to “scramble” the half-cooked pancake batter, breaking it into little pieces as it cooks. This should take about 5 minutes. Add another third of the batter as well as the cinnamon and sugar, letting it caramelise in the pan and coat the scramble. After another 5 minutes, repeat the process with the remaining batter. 5. Serve the pancakes with berries and cream or bananas and maple syrup, or simply dust with icing sugar. "

For the best texture, allow to set overnight. 7. Before serving, whip the remaining 250ml cream with the sugar and spread across the top of the tart.
