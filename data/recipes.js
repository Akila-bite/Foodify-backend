Pour into a greased or lined stainless-steel bowl, then cover with foil or clingwrap making sure it doesn’t touch the batter. 6. Place in a large saucepan half-filled with water – the bowl should not be submerged in the water. Cover, then steam for 1½ hours over a medium heat. Check the water level every 20 minutes and add more boiling water if necessary. 7. Use a toothpick or skewer to test whether the bread is ready; it should come out dry. If It’s still wet, steam it for a bit longer. Once ready, remove from the saucepan, allow to cool for 5 minutes, then flip the bowl upside down. Place the bread on a wire rack. Serve warm or cold. Cook’s note: You can replace imifino with your favourite leafy vegetable but make sure you drain any excess water "
